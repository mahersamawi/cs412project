To run our program:

```
python random_trees_trial.py inputs/train.txt inputs/user.txt inputs/movie.txt inputs/test.txt
```
The arguments are training data, user data, movie data, and the test data in that order.

The output of the program is the results written to a file called "result.txt" (make sure there is not a file with that name or it will be overwritten by the output)
