To run our program:

python smart_bayes/datap.py
python smart_bayes/test.py

To change data files, simply modify the contents of corresponding file in the data directory.

The second time you want to run the evaluation, if you already have files produced by smart_bayes/datap.py and wish to use the same file, you can directly run the second command.

The output of the program is the results written to a file called "smart_result.txt"
